Tracearr MCP Server

Exposes Tracearr's Public API v2 as MCP tools, so an MCP-compatible AI assistant
(e.g. Claude Code / Claude Desktop) can see who is watching what right now, browse
watch history, look up per-title and per-user play statistics, see what was recently
added, and check library sizes.

Every tool is read-only: the Public API v2 has no write endpoints, so nothing here
can change anything in Tracearr or on your media server.

Configuration is via environment variables:
  TRACEARR_URL        e.g. http://192.168.1.50:3000 (required)
  TRACEARR_API_KEY    Tracearr > Settings > General > API key, format
                      `trr_pub_<token>` (required). It must belong to an owner
                      account, otherwise Tracearr answers 403.
  MCP_HOST            interface to bind to (default 0.0.0.0)
  MCP_PORT            port to listen on (default 8942)
  MCP_AUTH_TOKEN      shared secret required as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
                      on every request (optional — if unset, the server is open
                      to anyone who can reach it; see README for why that matters
                      more than usual here: this API returns people's viewing
                      history and email addresses)

Tracearr's Public API v2 needs Tracearr 2.0.0 or later (earlier versions serve v1
only). It lives at a fixed `/api/v2/public` prefix, so there is no API-version
setting to configure. Auth is a Bearer API key (`trr_pub_...`). Tracearr rate-limits
one budget per key across the whole v2 surface, so a 429 is reported as such rather
than as a generic failure.

Transport: streamable-http. This runs as a standing network service (bind
0.0.0.0 inside the container; publish the port only on your internal
network/VLAN — never forward it externally) rather than being spawned
per-client over stdio, so any MCP client on the LAN can connect to
http://<host>:<port>/mcp.

Auth here is a single shared bearer token checked by plain middleware, not
the SDK's built-in OAuth support (mcp.server.auth) — that machinery expects
a full OAuth authorization server (issuer/resource metadata, RFC 8414/8707/
9068 discovery), which is unwarranted complexity for a single internal
secret shared by trusted LAN clients.
